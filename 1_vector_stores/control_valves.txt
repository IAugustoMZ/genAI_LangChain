1.1 What is a Control Valve?
Modern processing plants utilize a vast 
network of control loops to produce an 
end product for market. These control 
loops are designed to keep a process 
variable (i.e. pressure, flow, level, 
temperature, etc.) within a required 
operating range to ensure a quality end 
product is produced. Each of these loops 
receives and internally creates 
disturbances that detrimentally affect 
the process variable (PV). Interaction 
from other loops in the network also 
provide disturbances that influence the 
process variable. See Figure 1.1.

To reduce the effect of these load 
disturbances, sensors and transmitters 
collect information about the process 
variable (PV) and its relationship to some 
desired set point. A controller processes 
this information and decides what must 
be done to get the process variable back 
to where it should be after a load 
disturbance occurs. When all the 
measuring, comparing, and calculating 
are done, some type of final control 
element must implement the strategy 
selected by the controller. 
The most common final control element 
in the process control industries is the 
control valve. The control valve 
manipulates a flowing fluid, such as gas, 
steam, water, or chemical compounds to 
compensate for the load disturbance and 
keep the regulated process variable as 
close as possible to the desired set point. 
The control valve is a critical part of the 
control loop. Many people who talk 
about control valves are really referring 
to a control valve assembly. The control 
valve assembly typically consists of the 
valve body, the internal trim parts, an 
actuator to provide the motive power to 
operate the valve, and a variety of 
additional valve accessories, which can 
includes, transducers, supply pressure 
regulators, manual operators, snubbers, 
or limit switches. 
There are two main types of control 
valve designs, depending on the action 
of the closure member: sliding-stem or 
rotary. Sliding-stem valves, as seen in 
Figure 1.2 and 1.3, use linear motion to 
move a closure member into and out of 
a seating surface. Rotary valves, as seen 
in Figure 1.13 and 1.17, use rotational 
motion to turn a closure member into 
and out of a seating surface. 
1.2 Sliding-Stem Control 
Valve Terminology
The following terminology applies to the 
physical and operating characteristics of 
standard sliding-stem control valves 
with diaphragm or piston actuators. 
Some of the terms, particularly those 
pertaining to actuators, are also 
appropriate for rotary control valves. 
Many of the definitions presented are in 
accordance with ANSI/ISA-75.05.01, 
Control Valve Terminology, although 
other popular terms are also included. 
Additional explanation is provided for 
some of the more complex terms. 
Additional sections in this chapter follow 
that define specific terminology for 
rotary control valves, general process 
control, and control valve functions and 
characteristics.
Actuator Spring: A spring, or group of 
springs, enclosed in the yoke or actuator 
casing or piston cylinder that moves the 
actuator stem in a direction opposite to 
that created by loading pressure.
Actuator Stem: The part that connects 
the actuator to the valve stem and 
transmits motion (force) from the 
actuator to the valve.
Actuator Stem Extension: An extension 
of the piston actuator stem to provide a 
means of transmitting piston motion to 
the valve positioner. 
Actuator Stem Force: The net force 
from an actuator that is available for 
actual positioning of the valve plug, 
referred to as valve travel.
Angle Valve: A valve design in which the 
inlet and outlet ports are perpendicular 
to each other. See also Globe Valve.
Figure 1.4 Angle Valve
Bellows Seal Bonnet: A bonnet that 
uses a bellows for sealing against 
leakage around the closure member 
stem. See Figure 1.5.
Bonnet: The portion of the valve that 
contains the packing box and stem seal 
and can provide guiding for the valve 
stem. It provides the principal opening 
to the body cavity for assembly of 
internal parts or it can be an integral part 
of the valve body. It can also provide for 
the attachment of the actuator to the 
valve body. Typical bonnets are bolted, 
threaded, welded, pressure sealed, or 
integral with the body. This term is often 
used in referring to the bonnet and its 
included packing parts. More properly, 
this group of component parts should 
be called the bonnet assembly.
Bonnet Assembly (Commonly Bonnet, 
more properly Bonnet Assembly): An 
assembly including the part through 
which a valve stem moves and a means 
for sealing against leakage along the 
stem. It usually provides a means for 
mounting the actuator and loading the 
packing assembly, and maintains proper
alignment of the plug to the rest of the 
control valve assembly. See Figure 1.6.

valve body opening opposite the bonnet 
opening. It can include a guide bushing 
and/or serve to allow reversal of the 
valve action.
Bushing: A device that supports and/or 
guides moving parts such as valve stems 
and plugs.
Cage: A part of the valve trim that 
surrounds the closure member and can 
provide flow characterization and/or a 
seating surface. It also provides stability, 
guiding, balance, and alignment, and 
facilitates assembly of other parts of the 
valve trim. The walls of the cage contain 
openings that usually determine the 
flow characteristic of the control valve. 
See Figure 1.7.
Closure Member: The movable part of 
the valve that is positioned in the flow 
path to modulate the rate of flow 
through the valve.
Closure Member Guide: That portion of 
a closure member that aligns its 
movement in either a cage, seat ring 
(port guiding), bonnet, bottom flange, 
stem or any two of these.
Cylinder: The chamber of a piston 
actuator in which the piston moves.
Cylinder Closure Seal: The sealing 
element at the connection of the 
piston actuator cylinder to the yoke.
Diaphragm: A flexible, pressure 
responsive element that transmits 
force to the diaphragm plate and 
actuator stem.
Diaphragm Actuator: A fluid-powered 
device in which the fluid, usually 
compressed air (see Loading Pressure), 
acts upon a flexible component, the 
diaphragm to produce a force to move 
the closure member.
Diaphragm Case: A housing, 
consisting of top and bottom 
section, used for supporting a 
diaphragm and establishing one or 
two pressure chambers.

Diaphragm Plate: A rigid plate 
concentric with the diaphragm for 
transmitting force to the actuator stem.

in which the actuator stem extends 
with increasing loading pressure. See 
Figure 1.9.
Extension Bonnet: A bonnet with 
greater dimension between the 
packing box and bonnet flange for hot 
or cold service.
Figure 1.8 Three-Way Globe Valve
Globe Valve: A valve with a linear 
motion closure member, one or more 
ports, and a body distinguished by a 
globular shaped cavity around the port 
region. Globe valves can be further 
classified as: two-way single-ported 
(Figure 1.3); two-way double-ported; 
angle-style, or three-way (Figure 1.8).
Loading Pressure: Fluid, usually 
compressed air, applied to the diaphragm 
or piston in a pneumatic actuator.
Offset Valve: A valve construction 
having inlet and outlet line connections 
on different planes, but 180 degrees 
opposite each other.

Figure 1.10 Piston-Type Actuator
Piston-Type Actuator: A fluid powered 
device in which the fluid, usually 
compressed air, acts upon a movable 
piston to provide motion of the actuator 
stem and provide seating force upon 
closure. Piston-type actuators are 
classified as either double-acting, so that 
full power can be developed in either 
direction, or as spring-fail so that upon 
loss of supply power, the actuator moves 
the valve in the required direction of 
travel. See Figure 1.10.
Port: The flow control orifice of a 
control valve. 
Retaining Ring: A split ring that is used to 
retain a separable flange on a valve body.
Reverse-Acting Actuator: An actuator 
in which the actuator stem retracts with 
increasing loading pressure. Reverse 
actuators have a seal bushing installed in 
the upper end of the yoke to prevent 
leakage of the loading pressure along 
the actuator stem. See Figure 1.12.
Rubber Boot: A protective device to 
prevent entrance of damaging foreign 
material into the piston actuator 
seal bushing.
Seal Bushing: Top and bottom bushings 
that provide a means of sealing the 
piston actuator cylinder against leakage. 
Synthetic rubber O-rings are used in the 
bushings to seal the cylinder, the actuator 
stem, and the actuator stem extension.
Seat: The area of contact between the 
closure member and its mating surface 
that establishes valve shutoff.
Seat Load: The net contact force 
between the closure member and seat 
with stated static conditions. In practice,

the selection of an actuator for a given 
control valve will be based on how much 
force is required to overcome static, 
stem, and dynamic unbalance with an 
allowance made for adequate seat load.
Seat Ring: A part of the valve body 
assembly that provides a seating surface 
for the closure member and can provide 
part of the flow control orifice.
Separable Flange: A flange that fits over 
a valve body flow connection. It is 
generally held in place by means of a 
retaining ring.
Spring Adjuster: A fitting, usually 
threaded on the actuator stem or into 
the yoke, to adjust the spring 
compression (see bench set in Control 
Valve Functions and Characteristics 
Terminology).
Spring Seat: A plate to hold the spring 
in position and to provide a flat surface 
for the spring adjuster to contact.
Static Unbalance: The net force produced 
on the valve stem by the process fluid 
pressure acting on the closure member 
and stem with the fluid at rest and with 
stated pressure conditions.
Stem Connector: The device that 
connects the actuator stem to the 
valve stem.
Trim: The internal components of a valve 
that modulate the flow of the controlled 
fluid. In a globe valve body, trim would 
typically include closure member, seat 
ring, cage, stem, and stem pin.
Trim, Soft-Seated: Valve trim with an 
elastomeric, plastic, or other readily 
deformable material used either in the 
closure component or seat ring to 
provide tight shutoff with minimal 
actuator forces.
Valve Body: The main pressure 
boundary of the valve that also provides 
the pipe connecting ends, the fluid flow 
passageway, and supports the seating 
surfaces and the valve closure member. 
Among the most common valve body 
constructions are: single-ported valve 
bodies having one port and one valve 
plug; double-ported valve bodies having

two ports and one valve plug; two-way 
valve bodies having two flow 
connections, one inlet and one outlet; 
three-way valve bodies having three flow 
connections, two of which can be inlets 
with one outlet (for converging or mixing 
flows), or one inlet and two outlets (for 
diverging or diverting flows). The term 
“valve body”, or even just “body”, is 
frequently used in referring to the valve 
body together with its bonnet assembly 
and included trim parts. More properly, 
this group of components should be 
called the valve body assembly. 
Valve Body Assembly (Commonly Valve 
Body or Valve, more properly Valve Body 
Assembly): An assembly of a valve body, 
bonnet assembly, bottom flange (if 
used), and trim elements. The trim 
includes the closure member, which 
opens, closes, or partially obstructs one 
or more ports.
Valve Plug (Plug): A term frequently 
used to reference the valve closure 
member in a sliding-stem valve.
Valve Stem: In a linear motion valve, the 
part that connects the actuator stem 
with the closure member.
Yoke: The structure that rigidly connects 
the actuator power unit to the valve.
